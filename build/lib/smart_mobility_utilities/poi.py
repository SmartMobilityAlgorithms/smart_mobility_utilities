"""Class for creating POI (point of interest) with its full detailed geographic data
"""

class poi:
    """Initialize the POI by specifying the name of the place
    and the country in which the place exist and its OpenStreetMaps types

    We are relying on Nominatim API to query the OSM data. The name of
    the place could be just the name of the place like University of Toronto.

    You need to specify the name of the country so we can limit the search space,
    and as you probably imagine the same name of one place points to different places
    in different countries. You can find "London" in UK and in USA.

    As we have discussed in GettingStarted repositories there are three types of entities
    in OSM data, which is nodes and ways and relations. Nodes are just a place like a certain
    hospital or shop and ways/relations are just a set of nodes that specify some poly[gon-line]
    in a map. When we query Nominatim API with a certain address, it replies back with nodes/ways/relations
    that match that address, so we need the parameter osm_type to retrieve the right type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: the name/address of the POI
    country: the name of the country of the POI
    osm_type: data types of OSM entities [node - way - relation]

    Examples
    -------
    >>> UofT = poi("university of toronto", "canada")
    >>> UofT.coordinates
    ... (-79.3973638, 43.6620257)
    >>> UofT.address
    ... 'University of Toronto, St George Street, Universityâ€”Rosedale, Old Toronto, Toronto, Peel, Golden Horseshoe, Ontario, M5T 2Z9, Canada'

                    of the sub-routes and it also takes on consideration multiple things like
                    the number of turns in a given route and obstacles like gates in the roads
