Description: # Utilities
        
        This is behind the scenes for all the repositories and code in the book.
        
        ---
        
        Here is the general structure and where to look at if you want to see what is happening
        
        ```
        utils
        |
        |
        |
        └─── solvers.py ==> This module is meant to be just off-the-shelf solvers for combinatorial problems
        |                   that you can use directly after bundling your problem configuration as object
        |                   per the interface that is provided in ``problem.py``. We will walk through the design
        |                   and the thought process for writing every solver by solving a simple problem with it
        |                   after that you can just invoke the solver directly from this module.
        |
        |
        │       
        └─── common.py ==> This module is here for providing a nice interface to unnecessary complexity,
        |                  like handling graphs produced from osmnx and other utilities associated with
        │                  graphs.
        │ 
        |
        |
        │
        └─── problem.py ==> This module is for defining a number of classes for recurring combinatorial problems
        |                   that could be consumed by methods in ``solvers.py``
        │ 
        │
        │
        └─── jupyter.py ==> This module is for handling the quirks of jupyter notebook without 
        │                   polluting the notebook with distracting commands and functions
        │ 
        │ 
        │ 
        │  
        └─── viz.py ==> Wrapper around `folium` and `ipyleaflet` to ease visualization and choose the appropriate 
        |               library for visulaization based on the size of the graph and the environment the notebook
        |               running at.
        |
        |
        |
        |
        └─── poi.py ==> This module would be used to download data of point of interests and construct a graph based
                        on the actual roads between the POIs based on [`osrm`](http://project-osrm.org/) with a lot
                        of customization. It would be primarily used on case studies and hopefully it would be of some 
                        help in your projects at the end of the semester. 
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        If you are on a local machine you don't have to worry about anything at all, just make sure you installed everything on [Getting Started](https://github.com/SmartMobilityAlgorithms/GettingStarted).
        
        If you are on google colab, just upload the `.zip` file that is present in every repository to the default directory and everything would supposedly be fine.
        
        **If not**, don't hesitate for a second to open an issue here and we would go through the steps with you, you are here to learn search algorithms, not how to use package managers :computer: :computer:.
